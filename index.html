                    <p>I begin by asking myself what qualities I admire in human being. This outlined an ideal to aspire toward
                        and a counter-deal to steer clear of. I decided who it is that I want to be and then aimed, single mindedly
                        at that idea. I was the person that I would always want to be happy. I was an eldest daughter, working student
                        facing responsibilities in the family. Knowing myself it gives me a prescriptive identity that notified how 
                        I was to view the world and myself.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I know that my parents could not sustain my educational needs because of financial problem so 
                        I decided to embark on a journey toward personal discovery. I set out to establish a purpose, to be 
                        concise and tell the truth as best I could. I began seeking the answer; I desperately wished that someday
                        I will found a job and manager that could support my study. Fast-forward four years ago I found  a manager
                        with a golden a heart who offer me to study again and they will support my educational needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On that time I felt mixed emotions. I exhumed aspects of a life once lived and examined each piece carefully
                        for a thread to connect the past to the present. I desperately wished to afford my llife someday semblance of unity
                        and purpose. But the deeper I felt when my mom was died 4 years ago. I recognized myself as once.
                        I knew; I was responsible facing to help my family to support their needs especially my brother 
                        and sister. I will be the one who support their educational needs and for their daily needs. I had shed
                        the layers of an identity that served its purpose at  that time, but was no longer useful to my present way
                        of being in the world. Finding me involves a perpetual phoenix of re-capitulation. This is no trivial matter
                        if I could set my life in a manner that would make me pleased to exist then what would this look like.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My aim was to develop great habits through small tiny actions(micro-routines). In doing so, I hoped to maximize
                        the quality of my life in such a way that would be a benefit, my friends, family and the community.
                        Throughout the process of self-discovery, I learned that I could never truly lose myself because the self
                        is anything but constant and static, moment in time.</p>
